description: I have been fortunate to work on diverse independent research projects. At Princeton University, I studied last passage percolation and its scaling limit in the probabilistic sense, advised by Dr. Duncan Dauvergne. I also studied the dynamics of opinion exchange, i.e. convergence of opinions and consensus, in the network setting using the Voter model, DeGroot model, and a mixture of models, advised by Prof. Miklós Rácz. Another project I worked on was implementing a Gin Rummy-playing agent using Reinforcement Learning and other ML methods, advised by Prof. Michael Guerzhoy. With Dr. David Garcia at the Complexity Science Hub, Vienna, I worked on a project studying user-privacy on social networks like Twitter. With Drs. Lambert Moyon and Annalisa Marsico at the Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Germany, I worked on a project identifying sub-networks of genes deregulated during the infection of a pneumonia- causing bacterium. Currently, at the University of Washington, I ...
