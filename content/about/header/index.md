Hi, thank you for visiting my website! My name is Vydhourie, and I'm a Statistics PhD student at the University of Washington. I was born and raised in Selangor, Malaysia. After completing my A-levels, I did my undergraduate degree at Princeton University. At Princeton, I majored in Mathematics, and minored in Theater, Applied and Computational Mathematics, and Statistics and Machine Learning. As an applied mathematician and statistician, I am very interested in solving problems in using mathematical tools and my interests in network science and probability. I am also very interested in initiatives to foster diversity and inclusion in STEM, especially in Mathematics. As a teacher and mentor, practicing inclusivity is a big focus of mine. As a playwright, a goal of mine is to celebrate underrepresented voices in these fields.
